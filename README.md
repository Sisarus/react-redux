# How React and Redux work

## General

In this app we test how React and Redux work together.


## Setup

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Run
```
npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. You can open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.


## Overview
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application state. Redux, on the other hand, is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It provides a centralized state management solution, making it easier to manage and update application state.
